# Ontario Gateway Airlines Insurance Plan Selection Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was conducted to assist Ontario Gateway Corporation in selecting the most suitable insurance plan through simulated airplane crash scenarios. We analyzed the financial impact under five different scenarios: four insurance plans and a self-insurance option. The analysis focused on evaluating the cost distribution of each plan over a five-year period to determine the potential for catastrophic losses and conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis on the probability of airplane crashes.

## Key Findings
- **Hawthorne Insurance Corporation (HIC):** Offers the lowest average total costs over five years, but with a risk of extremely high expenses.
- **Canadian Trust Company (CTC):** Provides a plan with slightly higher average costs but significantly lower potential maximum costs.
- Based on the analysis, the CTC plan is recommended for Ontario Gateway to mitigate the risk of exceptionally high total losses, potentially preventing company bankruptcy.
